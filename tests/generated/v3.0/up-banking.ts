There is currently a limit of 10 webhooks at any given time. Once this limit is reached, existing webhooks will need to be deleted before new webhooks can be created. Event delivery is retried with exponential backoff if the URL is unreachable or it does not respond with a `200` status. The response includes a `secretKey` attribute, which is used to sign requests sent to the webhook URL. It will not be returned from any other endpoints within the Up API. If the `secretKey` is lost, simply create a new webhook with the same URL, capture its `secretKey` and then delete the original webhook. See [Handling webhook events](#callback_post_webhookURL) for details on how to process webhook events. It is probably a good idea to test the webhook by [sending it a `PING` event](#post_webhooks_webhookId_ping) after creating it.
